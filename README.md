Calculator üßÆ
Welcome to Calculator, a simple, stylish, and user-friendly web-based calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This calculator is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations with a clean interface, making it perfect for quick calculations or learning web development. Below is a detailed guide on how to use the calculator, its features, and instructions for setup.

Features ‚ú®
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Perform addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) with ease.
Decimal Support: Use the decimal point (.) for calculations involving non-whole numbers (e.g., 3.5 + 2.5 = 6).
Clear and Delete Functions:
AC button: Resets the display to start a new calculation.
DE button: Deletes the last character entered, useful for correcting mistakes.
Double Zero (00): Quickly input large numbers (e.g., 500).
Error Handling: Displays "Error" for invalid inputs, such as division by zero (5/0) or incomplete expressions (5+).
Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a great experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Additional Features:
Input Validation: Prevents invalid inputs like multiple decimals (3..3) or consecutive operators (++).
Keyboard Support: Allows input via keyboard for numbers, operators, and actions (e.g., Enter for =, Backspace for DE).
Prerequisites üìã
To run the calculator, you need:

A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
A text editor (e.g., VS Code) for viewing or modifying the code (optional).
Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (optional, for customization).
Installation and Setup üõ†Ô∏è
Download the Project Files:
Save the following files in a folder on your computer:
index.html (structure)
style.css (styling)
script.js (logic)
If the project is hosted on GitHub, you can clone it:
bash

Copy
git clone <https://github.com/utkarshrajtiwari/Calculator.git>
Open the Calculator:
Navigate to the project folder.
Double-click index.html to open it in your web browser, or drag the file into a browser window.
Run with a Local Server (Recommended):
For a smoother development experience, use a local server:
Install Visual Studio Code and the Live Server extension.
Open the project folder in VS Code.
Right-click index.html and select "Open with Live Server".
This ensures all styles and scripts load correctly.
How to Use the Calculator üìñ
Launch the Calculator:
Open index.html in a web browser to view the calculator interface, which includes a display and buttons for numbers, operators, and functions.
Perform Calculations:
Using Buttons:
Click number buttons (0-9, 00) to input numbers.
Click operator buttons (+, -, *, /) to add operations.
Use the . button for decimal numbers.
Click = to compute and display the result.
Example:
Input: 5 + 3 * 2
Click =
Output: 11 (follows BODMAS rules: multiplication before addition).
Correct or Reset Input:
Click AC to clear the display and start a new calculation.
Click DE to remove the last character (e.g., if you typed 123+ and want to delete +).
Handle Errors:
Invalid inputs (e.g., 5/0 or 5+) display "Error".
Use AC to reset and try again.
Keyboard Support:
Use your keyboard for faster input:
Numbers (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), and decimal (.) to build expressions.
Enter: Calculates the result (equivalent to =).
Backspace: Deletes the last character (equivalent to DE).
Escape: Clears the display (equivalent to AC).
Example: Type 5 + 3, press Enter, and see 8 on the display.
Additional Features Explained üîç
Input Validation:
The calculator prevents invalid inputs to improve user experience:
Blocks multiple decimal points in a single number (e.g., 3..3 is not allowed).
Prevents consecutive operators (e.g., ++ or *- are blocked).
This ensures calculations are logical and reduces errors.
Keyboard Support:
Added to make the calculator more efficient for users who prefer typing.
Supports all basic operations and special functions via keyboard shortcuts, making it faster for power users.
Project Structure üìÇ
index.html: Defines the calculator's structure, including the display and buttons.
style.css: Styles the calculator with a clean, responsive design and hover effects for buttons.
script.js: Contains the logic for handling inputs, calculations, and error management.
Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è
The calculator uses JavaScript's eval() function for evaluating expressions, which is suitable for this simple project but not recommended for production due to security risks (e.g., executing malicious code). Inputs are controlled via buttons and a readonly display, mitigating risks in this case.
Advanced mathematical functions (e.g., square root, percentages, parentheses) are not supported but can be added with libraries like math.js.
No calculation history is stored (future feature possibility).
Future Enhancements üåü
Advanced Functions: Add support for square root, exponents, or trigonometric functions using a library like math.js.
Calculation History: Save and display previous calculations.
Safer Evaluation: Replace eval() with a secure parser like math.js for better security.
Themes: Add light/dark mode or customizable colors for the UI.
Troubleshooting üêõ
Calculator not loading?
Ensure all files (index.html, style.css, script.js) are in the same folder.
Check that file paths in <link> and <script> tags are correct.
Buttons not working?
Verify that script.js is properly linked in index.html.
Open the browser's developer console (F12) to check for errors.
Styles missing?
Confirm that style.css is linked correctly and not blocked by browser cache (try a hard refresh: Ctrl + F5).
